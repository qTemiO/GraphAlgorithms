1) Make an virtual enviroment 
   $ python -m venv venv
   
2) Activate virtual enviroment
   `venv\Scripts\activate`
   or if you run on Linux
   `$ source venv/bin/activate`
   
3) Install some nessesary libs
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## TO BUILT this you should run the command in project folder:
